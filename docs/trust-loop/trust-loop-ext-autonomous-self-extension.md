# Nexo Trust Loop — Extension Spec: Autonomous Self-Extension

Specification v1.0 — companion to `nexo-trust-loop-spec.md` v1.0 and
the Analyzer Gate & Container Isolation extension spec.
Status: Draft for integration
Scope: The closed loop in which Nexo detects a need, proposes an
extension to itself, certifies it, admits it, hot-swaps it into the
running system, observes it, and rolls it back — with human authority
positioned exactly where it is load-bearing and nowhere else.
Builds on master as of `423bcfbc`: Invariants A–D
(`SelfProducedBrickCertificationPolicy`,
`AgentPolicyNarrowingValidator`, human admission, recursion ceiling),
`CertifiedBrickHotSwapHost`, `ProposalContextAssembler`,
`BrickConstraintManifest`, session sandboxes, analyzer gate.

Keywords MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD / MAY per RFC 2119.

## 0. Core Invariants

> **I-1. The loop may extend the system; it may never extend its own
> authority.** Gates, policies, admission tiers, the swap host, the
> certifier, budgets, and this spec's enforcement code are the
> *trust kernel*. No artifact produced by the loop may modify the
> trust kernel without human admission — under any tier, at any
> depth, under any objective.

> **I-2. Autonomy is bounded by blast radius, not by confidence.**
> What runs unattended is determined by a static classification of
> what the artifact can touch — never by gate scores, proposer
> self-assessment, or accumulated success history.

> **I-3. Every autonomous action is reversible or it does not run.**
> An extension without a proven rollback path MUST NOT be admitted
> at any autonomous tier.

## 1. Objective Intake: Needs Are Untrusted Input

The loop begins when the system decides something should exist. That
decision channel is an attack surface and MUST be treated as one.

- R1.1 Permitted objective sources, in trust order: (a) explicit human
  objective; (b) diagnosed failure class from CI/ledger triage;
  (c) observed workflow gap from watch/adapt telemetry. The source
  MUST be recorded on the objective and flows into the certificate's
  `inputs`.
- R1.2 Objectives derived from observed data (source c) are
  *untrusted*: content from watched workflows MUST NOT be
  interpolated into proposer instructions verbatim. It MUST pass
  through deterministic extraction (schema-constrained fields only)
  so that instruction-shaped text in watched data cannot become
  instruction (prompt-injection fence at the objective layer).
- R1.3 Every objective MUST be tier-classified (§3) *before* any
  proposal session starts, from its declared touch-set — the files,
  namespaces, and capabilities the extension is permitted to affect.
  The touch-set becomes the session's constraint manifest and its
  sandbox mount table (single declaration, three enforcement
  surfaces).
- R1.4 Objectives whose touch-set cannot be statically determined
  MUST be classified at the most restrictive applicable tier.

## 2. The Loop (normative shape)

```
observe → objective (tiered) → propose (session sandbox, cluster)
       → fences → analyzer gate → mutation gate → certify
       → admit (tier gate) → swap (generation) → watch
       → [regress? → rollback + quarantine + fence candidate]
       → ledger + provenance (always, every arc)
```

- R2.1 Every arc MUST emit provenance events; there is no unlogged
  path from objective to runtime.
- R2.2 The propose→certify segment is the parent spec unchanged. This
  spec adds no new acceptance authority: certification remains
  certificate-iff-gate-pass, minted only by the gate runner.
- R2.3 A single loop iteration MUST terminate in one of exactly:
  admitted-and-swapped, certified-but-held (awaiting human),
  explained-failure-with-artifacts, or budget-exhaustion-with-
  artifacts. (Parent R4.7 extended to the full loop.)

## 3. Admission Tiers

- R3.1 Tier classification is a function of touch-set only:
  - **Tier 0 — autonomous.** Leaf bricks: constraint manifest
    present, no reference into the trust kernel, no policy/security/
    tool-whitelist surface, no modification of another brick's
    contract. Certified Tier 0 artifacts MAY hot-swap without human
    approval.
  - **Tier 1 — human admission.** Everything touching the trust
    kernel (I-1's enumeration), agent capability surfaces, network
    allowlists, or any cross-brick contract change. Certification
    MAY proceed autonomously; *admission* MUST wait for the
    Invariant C human gate. Held artifacts persist with full
    evidence for review.
  - **Tier 2 — human objective.** Changes to tier classification
    rules themselves, budgets, or this spec's enforcement: the
    *objective* MUST originate from a human (R1.1 source a); machine
    sources MUST NOT even open a proposal session.
- R3.2 Tier enforcement MUST be structural, not conventional:
  the classifier operates on the touch-set manifest; the analyzer
  gate enforces the declared touch-set against the actual reference
  graph (undeclared reference into the kernel = gate FAIL); the
  swap host independently refuses Tier-mismatched admissions
  (defense in depth — three checks, one declaration).
- R3.3 Tier 0 autonomy MUST NOT be earnable. No success streak,
  metric, or human toggle may promote a kernel-touching artifact
  class to Tier 0 (I-2). Widening Tier 0's definition is itself a
  Tier 2 change.

## 4. Recursion Discipline

Extensions can produce extensions. Depth is where autonomy quietly
becomes autonomy².

- R4.1 Every artifact MUST carry a `generation_depth`: human-authored
  code is depth 0; an artifact proposed by a loop whose proposer/
  tooling includes depth-n artifacts is depth n+1.
- R4.2 A hard depth ceiling MUST be enforced (default 2) by the
  certifier and independently by the swap host. Raising the ceiling
  is Tier 2.
- R4.3 Self-produced artifacts MUST NOT serve as gates, probes,
  fences, or analyzers for other candidates until a human admits
  them into the verification role (Tier 1 regardless of touch-set) —
  the loop may not grow its own judges autonomously.
- R4.4 `AgentPolicyNarrowingValidator` semantics extend transitively:
  a depth-n+1 session's capabilities MUST be a subset of the
  depth-n session that produced its proposer context. Capability
  monotonically narrows with depth; it never widens.

## 5. Post-Swap Observation and Rollback

Certification proves the artifact passed its gates; it does not prove
the gates were sufficient. The runtime is the last gate.

- R5.1 The swap host MUST retain generation N (bytes + certificate)
  when activating N+1, for a configured retention window. Rollback =
  reactivate N; it MUST require no build, no network, and no model.
- R5.2 Every Tier 0 swap MUST enter a watch window: declared-contract
  conformance (bag reads/writes vs. interface), error-rate and
  latency deltas vs. the generation baseline, and resource ceilings.
  Threshold breach MUST trigger automatic rollback.
- R5.3 A rolled-back artifact is *quarantined*: its certificate is
  marked revoked in the record store, the swap host MUST refuse the
  hash permanently, and the failure MUST be triaged into a probe,
  fence, or analyzer rule (parent R3.3) before any successor
  objective for the same gap is opened — the loop learns before it
  retries.
- R5.4 Revocation MUST propagate through certificate chains: any
  certificate whose `inputs` include a revoked artifact becomes
  suspect and MUST be flagged for re-verification.
- R5.5 Repeated rollback on one objective lineage (default: 2) MUST
  demote the lineage to Tier 1 — autonomy is lost on evidence, even
  though it is never gained on it (I-2 is asymmetric by design).

## 6. Cadence, Budgets, and the Pause

- R6.1 Cluster budgets (parent R4.6, extension B11.2) apply per loop
  iteration; additionally the loop MUST enforce a generation cadence
  floor (minimum interval between autonomous swaps) so the runtime
  is never absorbing changes faster than the watch window can
  clear them. In-flight watch windows MUST block the next autonomous
  swap of the same lineage.
- R6.2 A global pause MUST exist, honoring the platform's pause
  semantics: pause halts objective intake and swaps immediately;
  in-flight proposal sessions run to a clean terminal state and
  hold. Pause MUST NOT corrupt state or lose artifacts. Resume
  requires no reconstruction.
- R6.3 Pause, rollback, quarantine, and tier demotion MUST function
  fully offline (air-gap invariant: no autonomy control depends on
  egress).

## 7. Human Visibility Without Human Bottleneck

- R7.1 Tier 0 autonomy MUST NOT mean silence: every autonomous swap,
  rollback, and quarantine MUST appear in a human-reviewable digest
  (per-session and periodic), with one-hop links into the provenance
  graph.
- R7.2 A human MUST be able to, at any time: demote any lineage to
  Tier 1, revoke any certificate, roll back any generation, and
  pause the loop — each as a single operation not requiring a
  proposal session.
- R7.3 The digest MUST distinguish "the loop did X" from "the loop
  proposes X and is holding" — held Tier 1 artifacts are presented
  with evidence, never auto-expired into abandonment without a
  recorded human-visible disposition.

## 8. Adversarial Validation (acceptance for autonomy)

Production-readiness for unattended Tier 0 operation additionally
requires, with zero false certificates and zero unauthorized swaps:

- objective injection: instruction-shaped content planted in watched
  workflow data → never reaches proposer instructions as instruction
  (R1.2 fence holds)
- kernel-touch smuggling: Tier 0 objective whose candidate references
  the trust kernel indirectly (transitive dependency, reflection,
  generated code) → analyzer gate FAIL and swap-host refusal both
  fire (R3.2 triple-check proven independently, each with the others
  disabled in harness)
- judge-growth attempt: self-produced artifact registered as a gate/
  probe/analyzer without human admission → refused (R4.3)
- depth laundering: depth-2 artifact proposing via a fresh session to
  reset `generation_depth` → detected via input-chain hashes,
  refused (R4.1/R4.2)
- capability re-widening at depth: depth-n+1 session requesting a
  tool absent from its parent's whitelist → refused (R4.4)
- regression theater: candidate healthy in gates, misbehaving only
  post-swap → watch window catches, auto-rollback within threshold,
  quarantine + revocation propagate (R5.2–R5.4)
- revoked-hash resubmission (bit-identical and near-variant) →
  refused permanently / re-gated respectively
- pause under load: pause issued mid-cluster with swaps queued →
  no swap after pause acknowledgment, all sessions reach clean
  terminal states, resume is lossless (R6.2)
- one full "ends good" arc: machine-sourced objective (R1.1b) →
  Tier 0 classification → cluster proposal → certification →
  autonomous swap → clean watch window → digest entry with complete
  provenance chain, end to end with no human touch — and its mirror
  "ends bad" arc terminating in quarantine with the fence catalog
  grown by one.

## 9. Design Rationale (non-normative)

- The tier boundary is placed on *authority*, not on *difficulty*.
  Models will get better at hard changes; they must never get closer
  to the kernel by being better. I-2's asymmetry (autonomy lost on
  evidence, never gained on it) is deliberate: it makes the safe
  direction the cheap direction permanently.
- Rollback-before-admission (I-3) converts autonomy from a courage
  question into an engineering question. The system is allowed to be
  wrong at Tier 0 precisely because being wrong is bounded, observed,
  reversible, and — via quarantine-to-fence — educational.
- The recursion rules encode the SX-HARDEN lesson as arithmetic:
  depth increments, capability narrows, judges require humans. A
  loop under these constraints can compound capability indefinitely
  while its authority stays exactly where it started — which is the
  only version of "self-improving system" an auditor, a customer, or
  its author should accept.
