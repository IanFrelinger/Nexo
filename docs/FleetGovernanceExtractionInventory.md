# Fleet and mesh governance extraction inventory

This inventory guided fleet and networking extraction. **Fleet (Phases C–E) and networking (Phase F) are complete** on `master`; remaining items are optional CLI splits and governance modules. It classifies fleet, mesh, and networking code before moving it so the commercial boundary stays reviewable.

Classification terms:

- **OPEN primitive** — single-node, inspectable, local-first, or trust primitive. May stay Apache-2.0.
- **COMMERCIAL fleet/governance** — multi-node control plane, fleet scheduling, director persistence, leases/checkpoints, knowledge replication, worker execution, or org-scale governance. Should move to commercial modules before commercial licensing is applied.
- **SPLIT / owner decision** — a file mixes open primitive behavior with fleet-scale behavior or needs an owner call on packaging.

## Summary recommendation

1. Keep low-level mesh primitives open: peer descriptors, local instance discovery/advertisement, artifact negotiation, local transport, and trust configuration primitives.
2. Extract all `Fleet` projects/files into commercial contracts/core/infrastructure modules.
3. Extract `Networking` knowledge-sync / network-bus / adaptive-cache surfaces into commercial fleet/governance modules unless the owner explicitly wants a smaller open networking substrate.
4. Split CLI/API surfaces so open CLI/API retain local mesh inspection and trust middleware, while `mesh director`, fleet registration/admission, and director operations move to commercial modules.
5. Move fleet/mesh governance tests with the commercial code they validate.

## Proposed commercial modules

| `commercial/src/Ashlar.Commercial.Fleet.Infrastructure` | LiteDB registries, worker executor client/background service, director persistence, import/export implementations, sweep/rebalance services. |
| `commercial/src/Ashlar.Commercial.Fleet.Api` | Commercial `/api/mesh` fleet/task/knowledge endpoint extension seeded from open `Ashlar.API`. |
| `commercial/src/Ashlar.Commercial.Fleet.Host` | Commercial operator host wiring `AddAshlarCommercialFleetDirector()` and `MapCommercialFleetEndpoints()`. |

| `commercial/tests/Ashlar.Commercial.Tests.Fleet` | Fleet/director/governance tests moved out of open test projects. |

## OPEN primitive inventory

These files should remain open unless a later extraction finds unavoidable fleet-only semantics.

### Core mesh contracts and models

| Path | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `src/Ashlar.Core.Application/Mesh/Models/Artifact.cs` | Portable artifact descriptor for local/import/export flows. |
| `src/Ashlar.Core.Application/Mesh/Models/CapabilityDescriptor.cs` | Inspectable capability metadata used by local nodes and SDK consumers. |

| `src/Ashlar.Core.Application/Mesh/Models/PeerInfo.cs` | Peer descriptor used by discovery and local operator inspection. |

| `src/Ashlar.Core.Application/Mesh/Ports/IArtifactNegotiator.cs` | Local artifact negotiation primitive. |
| `src/Ashlar.Core.Application/Mesh/Ports/ICapabilityAdvertisement.cs` | Local capability advertisement primitive. |

## Updated extraction sequence

### PR 4 — fleet inventory split

This document. No code moves.

### PR 5 — commercial fleet contracts/core

Create the commercial contracts module and seed it with copied fleet contract DTOs/ports while open consumers are still being migrated:

- `commercial/src/Ashlar.Commercial.Fleet.Contracts`
- Seed from `src/Ashlar.Core.Application/Fleet/**`
- Keep the original open files temporarily until commercial infrastructure/API consumers move in later PRs.

Then move:

- commercial-classified `src/Ashlar.Core.Application/Networking/**` ports/models, if owner confirms those are not part of a smaller open networking substrate.

### PR 6 — commercial fleet infrastructure

Create the commercial fleet infrastructure module and seed it with copied fleet implementation code while open consumers are still being migrated:

- `commercial/src/Ashlar.Commercial.Fleet.Infrastructure`
- Seed from `src/Ashlar.Infrastructure/Fleet/**`
- Keep the original open files temporarily until commercial API/CLI consumers move in later PRs.

Then move:

- commercial-classified `src/Ashlar.Infrastructure/Networking/**`
- fleet tests from `src/Ashlar.Tests.Infrastructure/Tests/Fleet/**`

Create:

- `commercial/src/Ashlar.Commercial.Fleet.Infrastructure`
- `commercial/tests/Ashlar.Commercial.Tests.Fleet`

### PR 7 — commercial mesh director / CLI surface

Seed commercial module and then move or split:

- `MeshDirectorCommand` (commercial module owns this now)
- ~~commercial portions of `MeshHubCommand`~~ (done: `director list-nodes` / `director health`)
- related URI tests (commercial module owns these now)

Create:

- `commercial/src/Ashlar.Commercial.MeshDirector`

### PR 8 — commercial fleet API baseline

Seed commercial endpoint module:

- `commercial/src/Ashlar.Commercial.Fleet.Api`
- copy `/api/mesh/fleet/**`, `/api/mesh/tasks/**`, and `/api/mesh/knowledge/**` endpoint mappings/handlers/DTOs from open `Ashlar.API`;
- use commercial fleet contracts/infrastructure namespaces.

### PR 9 — commercial fleet host wiring (done)

Added:

- `commercial/src/Ashlar.Commercial.Fleet.Host` — operator host registering `AddAshlarCommercialFleetDirector()` and mapping `MapCommercialFleetEndpoints()`;
- `commercial/src/Ashlar.Commercial.Fleet.Api/CommercialFleetHostExtensions.cs` — shared DI/endpoint wiring helper;
- `commercial/tests/Ashlar.Commercial.Tests.Fleet.Host` and `scripts/commercial-fleet-host-smoke.sh` — host build/smoke validation;
### PR 10 — open fleet endpoint cleanup (done)

Completed:

- removed open `/api/mesh/fleet/**`, `/api/mesh/tasks/**`, and `/api/mesh/knowledge/**` endpoint handlers from `Ashlar.API`;
- migrated mesh-lab **peer-a** to `.docker/Dockerfile.fleet-host` (`Ashlar.Commercial.Fleet.Host`);
- mesh-lab verify scripts unchanged (same HTTP paths; director is now the commercial host).

### PR 11 — open fleet infrastructure cleanup (done)

Completed:

- removed `src/Ashlar.Core.Application/Fleet/**` and `src/Ashlar.Infrastructure/Fleet/**`;
- extracted mesh-lab worker executor to `src/Ashlar.Infrastructure/MeshLab/**` (open HTTP client only);
- moved fleet unit tests to `commercial/tests/Ashlar.Commercial.Tests.Fleet`;
- kept mesh-lab worker executor tests under `src/Ashlar.Tests.Infrastructure/Tests/MeshLab/**`.

### PR 12 — dependency-boundary scanner (done)

Added:

- `scripts/verify-open-commercial-dependency-boundary.py` — classifies projects, scans `ProjectReference` edges, checks `COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md`, and evaluates open packable `PackageLicenseExpression`;
- `scripts/dependency-boundary-gate.sh` — strict wrapper (`DEPENDENCY_BOUNDARY_STRICT=1`);
- `scripts/dependency-boundary.open-to-commercial.allowlist.txt` — documented exception list (empty by default);
- `.github/workflows/dependency-boundary.yml` — CI gate on `.csproj` / licensing path changes;
- `make dependency-boundary-gate`.
