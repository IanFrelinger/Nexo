# Pipeline Architecture Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Nexo framework is being refactored to use a **Pipeline Architecture** as its core foundation. This architectural change will enable true plug-and-play functionality where any feature can be mixed and matched between projects, providing universal composability, dynamic workflow creation, and enhanced flexibility.

## Core Pipeline Components

### 1. Commands (Atomic Operations)
Every operation in the framework becomes a command that implements the `ICommand` interface:

```csharp
public interface ICommand
{
    string CommandId { get; }
    string Name { get; }
    string Description { get; }
    string Category { get; }
    IEnumerable<string> Tags { get; }
    bool CanExecuteInParallel { get; }
    int Priority { get; }
    IEnumerable<string> Dependencies { get; }
    
    Task<CommandValidationResult> ValidateAsync(IPipelineContext context);
    Task<CommandResult> ExecuteAsync(IPipelineContext context);
    Task CleanupAsync(IPipelineContext context, CommandResult result);
}
```

### 2. Behaviors (Command Collections)
Behaviors are collections of commands that work together to achieve a specific goal:

```csharp
public interface IBehavior
{
    string BehaviorId { get; }
    string Name { get; }
    string Description { get; }
    IEnumerable<ICommand> Commands { get; }
    BehaviorExecutionStrategy ExecutionStrategy { get; }
    
    Task<BehaviorValidationResult> ValidateAsync(IPipelineContext context);
    Task<BehaviorResult> ExecuteAsync(IPipelineContext context);
}
```

### 3. Aggregators (Pipeline Orchestrators)
Aggregators orchestrate the execution of commands and behaviors:

```csharp
public interface IAggregator
{
    string AggregatorId { get; }
    string Name { get; }
    AggregatorExecutionStrategy ExecutionStrategy { get; }
    int MaxParallelExecutions { get; }
    TimeSpan Timeout { get; }
    
    void RegisterCommand(ICommand command);
    void RegisterBehavior(IBehavior behavior);
    Task<AggregatorResult> ExecuteAsync(IPipelineContext context);
    PipelineExecutionPlan GetExecutionPlan();
}
```

### 4. Pipeline Context (Universal State)
The pipeline context carries state through the entire pipeline execution:

```csharp
public interface IPipelineContext
{
    string ExecutionId { get; }
    string PipelineName { get; }
    DateTimeOffset StartedAt { get; }
    string WorkingDirectory { get; }
    PlatformInfo Platform { get; }
    PipelineConfiguration Configuration { get; }
    IDictionary<string, object> Data { get; }
    ILogger Logger { get; }
    CancellationToken CancellationToken { get; }
}
```
