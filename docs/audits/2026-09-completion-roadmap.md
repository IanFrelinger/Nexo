# Ashlar Completion Roadmap: Path to Autonomous Self-Extension

**Date:** 2026-09-05  
**Status:** CEO Briefing — Audit Report  
**Objective:** Runtime capable of autonomous self-extensions and validation with built-in agents, maintaining PRODUCT/CORE separation

---

## Executive Summary

Ashlar has **proven the technical foundation** for autonomous self-extension: certification gates enforce safety invariants, tier-based admission controls blast radius, session sandboxing contains execution, and dogfood validation demonstrates the loop end-to-end. The remaining work is **hardening, adversarial validation, product separation, and public accountability** — not fundamental research.

**Current Position:**
- ✅ Safety invariants A–D enforced in production paths
- ✅ Autonomous iteration harness proven through P6/S5 campaigns
- ✅ Tier 0 autonomous admission with rollback/quarantine cycle
- ✅ Product split architecture documented and boundary-gated
- ⚠️  Certification signature model has exploitable downgrades (limitations 7–9)
- ⚠️  Adversarial validation coverage incomplete
- ⚠️  Product repos not extracted; Forge product surface undefined
- ⚠️  Public ledger for autonomous runs not implemented

**The Path Forward:**

Six milestones (M0–M6) progress from honesty baseline to commercial claims. Each milestone has clear **exit criteria**, **dependencies**, and **ownership**. Conservative estimate: **M0–M3 can close in the current development cycle**; M4–M6 require product-team coordination and sustained dogfood operation.

**Key Risk:** Certification schema vulnerabilities (limitations 7–9) are **publicly documented**; adversaries can strip signatures or downgrade to weak lanes. M1 MUST close these before any commercial claim.

---

## M0: Honesty Baseline — What We Can Claim Today

**Goal:** Establish the current provable state with zero false claims.

### Proven Capabilities

| Capability | Evidence | Limitations |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Autonomous brick generation & certification** | P6 live model proposals; S5 3/5 certified at qwen3.8:27b; cert-gate CI runs 27918340788, 27918244198 | Single-task family (damage→health compositions); recorded/replay model only in CI; live models local-only |
| **Safety invariants enforced** | SELF-EXTEND-AUDIT verdicts A–D all ENFORCED; SelfExtendInvariant*Tests pass | Certification signature downgrade exploits documented (limitations 7–9); no adversarial campaign yet |
| **Tier-based admission control** | Trust-loop spec sections 3, 7; Tier 0/1/2 classifier structural | Tier definitions not adversarially validated; kernel-touch smuggling untested |
| **Session containment** | P3-P5 flights: in-session build + execution; Docker backend hardening M26 | Host retains orchestration, mutant compilation, judgment (limitation 4); read-only rootfs unflown on live daemon |
| **Rollback & quarantine** | Trust-loop spec R5.1–R5.4; swap-host generation retention | Watch-window breach → auto-rollback path unflown (mechanism exists, not proven) |
| **Dogfood blocks 1–10** | DogfoodValidation.md; all test classes pass | Covers observation→adaptation→mesh; not closed-loop autonomous extension under adversarial conditions |
| **Product split architecture** | product-split.md; dependency-boundary-gate enforces src/→products/ prohibition | Products not extracted; Forge product surface undefined |

### Current Commercial Position

**Claimable Today:**
- "Certified brick generation with autonomous admission controls"
- "Structural safety enforcement with rollback capability"
- "Tier-based admission system with human gates for kernel changes"

**NOT Claimable:**
- ❌ "Adversarially hardened autonomous extension" (no adversarial campaign)
- ❌ "Production-ready unattended operation" (signature vulnerabilities public)
- ❌ "Public audit trail" (no ledger yet)
- ❌ "Forge product" (not extracted, not integrated)

### Exit Criteria

- [x] **M0.1** Document current proven state in this roadmap
- [x] **M0.2** Mark all non-proven claims as blocked
- [ ] **M0.3** CEO/board briefing: "We have the mechanism; here's what's between us and claims"
- [ ] **M0.4** Publish honesty baseline externally (blog/docs)

**Owner:** Framework team (documentation); CEO (external communication)  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Completion Target:** Current state (this document closes M0.1–M0.2)

## M1: Core Self-Extend Hardening — Seal, Hold, Canary, Disarm

**Goal:** Close certification vulnerabilities, prove CI enforcement, add disarm mechanisms.

### Work Streams

#### M1.1: Certification Schema Hardening

**Problem:** Limitations 7–9 allow signature stripping, schema downgrade, and key injection bypass.

**Fixes Required:**

1. **Close signature downgrade (limitation 7)**
   - Implement `CertificationVerifyOptions.RequireEd25519Signature` (already drafted, not compiled)
   - Implement `TrustedEd25519PublicKeys` pinning against `operator.pub` ONLY (not `~/.ashlar/keys/trusted/`)
   - Default REMAINS permissive for netstandard2.0 compatibility; hardened deployments opt in
   - **Exit:** `FileCertificationRecordStore` refuses stripped-signature records when `RequireEd25519Signature=true`; test via `SchemaVersionFloorTests` pattern (forge a record, strip signature, verify → refusal)

2. **Close schema downgrade (limitation 8)**
   - Enforce `CertificationVerifyOptions.MinimumSchemaVersion` (already drafted, not compiled)
   - Test: forged record with rewritten `Gate` field verifies at floor 0, refused at floor 2
   - **Exit:** `SchemaVersionFloorTests` pass; CI gates set `MinimumSchemaVersion=2` for all trust-bearing paths

3. **Fix composition signer key injection (limitation 9)**
   - `CompositionCertificationRecordSigner` constructor honors explicitly supplied `brickSigner` instead of discarding it
   - Remove `_ = brickSigner;` discard; thread through key resolution
   - **Exit:** Host passing real key via `brickSigner` mints compositions under that key, not committed constant

**Acceptance:**
- All three fixes compiled, tested, merged
- CI cert-gate updated to require floor 2 + signature
- Limitation 7–9 sections in certification-evidence.md marked CLOSED with fix commit refs

**Owner:** Runtime team (cryptography/certification subsystem)  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Risk:** netstandard2.0 consumers break if we flip defaults; keep defaults permissive, document opt-in hardening  
**Effort:** 3–5 days (fixes are drafted, need compilation + tests)

#### M1.2: Hold-Admit-Swap CI Proof

**Problem:** Tier 1 hold → human admission → swap path exercised only in local spikes, not CI.

**Acceptance Test:**
- New CI job `self-extend-admission-gate.yml`:
  - Propose a kernel-touching change (Tier 1)
  - Loop holds (no swap)
  - Simulate human approval (`IApprovalGate.ApproveAsync`)
  - Verify swap occurs post-approval
  - Passes on master pushes and PR
- **Exit:** CI green; test demonstrates Tier 1 hold → admit → swap with no false admits

**Owner:** CI/platform team  
**Dependencies:** M1.1 (certification hardening)  
**Effort:** 2–3 days

#### M1.3: Canary Tier 0 Swap in CI

**Problem:** Autonomous Tier 0 swaps only flown locally; no CI proof of end-to-end admission.

**Acceptance Test:**
- CI job `autonomous-canary-gate.yml`:
  - Load a pre-approved Tier 0 objective (leaf brick: no kernel touch)
  - Run full loop (propose → certify → autonomous admit → swap)
  - Verify generation N+1 active
  - Post-swap: 3 invocations, verify correctness
  - Passes on master only (not PR — no unattended swaps on PR branches)
- **Exit:** CI green; proves Tier 0 autonomous path including swap

**Owner:** Autonomy team  
**Dependencies:** M1.1, M1.2  
**Effort:** 3–4 days

#### M1.4: Disarm Mechanisms Proven

**Problem:** Pause, rollback, quarantine exist (trust-loop spec R5, R6) but not CI-proven.

**Acceptance Tests:**

1. **Pause under load:**
   - Simulator: queue 5 autonomous objectives
   - Issue pause mid-flight
   - Verify: no swaps after pause acknowledgment; in-flight sessions terminate cleanly; resume lossless
   - Test: `DisarmPauseUnderLoadTests.PauseIssuedMidFlight_NoSwapsAfterAck_ResumeLossless`

2. **Rollback on watch-window breach:**
   - Swap generation N+1 (known-bad candidate: sleeps 10s per invocation)
   - Watch window detects latency breach
   - Verify: auto-rollback to N; N+1 hash quarantined; revocation in store
   - Test: `DisarmRollbackTests.WatchWindowBreachLatency_AutoRollback_HashQuarantined`

3. **Quarantine propagates:**
   - Quarantine a Tier 0 brick B1
   - Verify: composition C1 that includes B1 flagged suspect (R5.4)
   - Test: `DisarmQuarantinePropagationTests.ConstituentQuarantined_CompositionFlaggedSuspect`

**Exit:** All three test classes pass in CI

**Owner:** Runtime team (swap host, watch window)  
**Dependencies:** M1.3 (canary swap must exist to roll back from)  
**Effort:** 5–7 days

### M1 Exit Criteria

- [ ] **M1.1** Limitations 7–9 closed; certification-evidence.md updated
- [ ] **M1.2** Tier 1 hold → admit → swap proven in CI
- [ ] **M1.3** Tier 0 autonomous swap proven in CI (canary)
- [ ] **M1.4** Pause, rollback, quarantine proven in CI
- [ ] **M1.5** All M1 gates green on master for 7 consecutive days

**Owner:** Runtime + CI teams  
**Dependencies:** M0 (baseline documented)  
**Completion Target:** 15–20 engineering days from M0 sign-off

---

## M2: Adversarial Validation Pack — Injection, Smuggling, Evasion

**Goal:** Trust-loop spec §8 adversarial campaign plus self-extend spec §8 autonomous-specific attacks.

### Attack Scenarios (Required)

#### Trust-Loop Base Pack (from trust-loop-spec.md §8)

| Attack | Defense | Test |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Sandbox escape** (path traversal, out-of-root reads) | `ProposerConfinement` + session scratch paths | `AdversarialSandboxEscapeTests` |
| **Premature completion** (proposer claims done on failing artifact) | Gate verdict is authority; proposer self-reports ignored | `AdversarialPrematureCompletionTests` |
| **Malformed actions** (null args, unknown actions) | Harness validates action schema | `AdversarialMalformedActionsTests` |
| **Anchor abuse** (nonexistent/ambiguous edit anchors) | Anchored-edit verifier rejects | `AdversarialAnchorAbuseTests` |
| **Oscillation** (non-converging edit sequences) | Hash-history detects revisits; budget ceiling enforces | `AdversarialOscillationTests` |
| **Oversized outputs** (garbage/too-large artifacts) | Artifact size ceiling enforced by harness | `AdversarialOversizedOutputTests` |
| **"Ends bad" run** (proposer ships broken work) | No certificate without gate pass | `AdversarialEndsBadTests` |
| **"Recovers" run** (proposer repairs to good work) | Certified with full provenance | `AdversarialRecoversTests` |

#### Autonomous-Specific Pack (from self-extend spec §8)

| Attack | Defense | Test |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Objective injection** (instruction-shaped content in watched workflow) | Schema-constrained extraction (R1.2) | `AdversarialObjectiveInjectionTests` |
| **Kernel-touch smuggling** (indirect reference via transitive dep) | Analyzer gate + swap-host triple-check (R3.2) | `AdversarialKernelTouchSmugglingTests` |
| **Judge-growth attempt** (self-produced artifact as gate) | Human admission required (R4.3) | `AdversarialJudgeGrowthTests` |
| **Depth laundering** (reset generation_depth via fresh session) | Input-chain hashes detect (R4.1/R4.2) | `AdversarialDepthLaunderingTests` |
| **Capability re-widening** (depth-n+1 requests absent tool) | Policy narrowing validator (R4.4) | `AdversarialCapabilityReWideningTests` |
| **Regression theater** (healthy in gates, misbehaves post-swap) | Watch window + auto-rollback (R5.2–R5.4) | `AdversarialRegressionTheaterTests` |
| **Revoked-hash resubmission** (bit-identical) | Quarantine store permanent refusal | `AdversarialRevokedHashResubmissionTests` |
| **Pause theater** (pause issued, swaps continue) | Pause halts intake & swaps immediately (R6.2) | `AdversarialPauseTheaterTests` |

### Acceptance Criteria

- All 16 attack tests implemented as xUnit test classes in `src/Ashlar.Tests.Infrastructure/Tests/Adversarial/`
- CI gate `adversarial-validation-gate.yml` runs full pack on every PR touching autonomy/certification paths
- **Campaign requirement:** Zero false certificates, zero unauthorized swaps across all scenarios
- **"Ends good" proof:** One full machine-sourced objective → Tier 0 classification → certified → autonomous swap → clean watch window → digest entry (trust-loop spec §8 requirement)
- **"Ends bad" proof:** Same path terminating in quarantine with fence catalog grown by one

### Work Estimate

- **Setup:** Test harness for controlled proposer doubles (2 days)
- **Base pack:** 8 tests × 1 day each = 8 days
- **Autonomous pack:** 8 tests × 1.5 days each = 12 days
- **Integration:** CI gate + campaign orchestration (3 days)
- **Total:** 25 engineering days

**Owner:** Security + runtime teams  
**Dependencies:** M1 (hardened core must exist to validate against)  
**Completion Target:** 25 days from M1 close

### M2 Exit Criteria

- [ ] **M2.1** All 16 adversarial tests green
- [ ] **M2.2** `adversarial-validation-gate.yml` enforced on master
- [ ] **M2.3** Campaign log published: X scenarios, 0 false admits, Y fences added
- [ ] **M2.4** Trust-loop spec §8 acceptance criteria met

**Risk:** Attack surface is large; expect to discover new defenses needed during test implementation. Budget 20% contingency.

## M3: Forge Product Repo Scaffold + Consumes Ashlar

**Goal:** Extract Forge as a consuming product repo, demonstrating PRODUCT/CORE separation.

### Architecture (from product-split.md)

**Forge** is an **adaptive app-factory product**, NOT framework. It:
- Consumes Ashlar via NuGet packages (`Ashlar.Hosting`, `Ashlar.Contracts`)
- Provides UX for "generate an app from objective"
- Ships as a separate product with its own roadmap
- **Never** referenced by `src/Ashlar.*` (one-way rule enforced by dependency-boundary-gate)

### M3 Deliverables

#### M3.1: Forge Repo Scaffold

**Structure:**
```
github.com/IanFrelinger/ashlar-forge/
├── src/
│   ├── Ashlar.Forge/                    # Core Forge product
│   ├── Ashlar.Forge.Cli/                # CLI entrypoint
│   └── Ashlar.Forge.Contracts/          # Forge-specific contracts
├── tests/
│   └── Ashlar.Forge.Tests/
├── docs/
│   ├── README.md                         # Forge product docs
│   └── ConsumesCoreVersion.md            # Pins Ashlar core version
├── .github/workflows/
│   └── forge-gate.yml                    # Forge CI (builds, tests)
└── Ashlar.Forge.sln
```

**Key files:**
- `src/Ashlar.Forge/Ashlar.Forge.csproj`:
  ```xml
  <PackageReference Include="Ashlar.Hosting" Version="0.1.2" />
  <PackageReference Include="Ashlar.Contracts" Version="0.1.2" />
  ```
- No `ProjectReference` to `../Ashlar/src/**` allowed (consumes NuGet only)

**Acceptance:**
- Forge repo created on GitHub
- `dotnet build` succeeds against published Ashlar packages
- CI green (basic build/test)
- README states: "Forge is a product built on Ashlar framework; see github.com/IanFrelinger/Ashlar"

**Effort:** 2 days (repo setup + skeleton)

#### M3.2: Forge Consumes Ashlar Trust Services

**Problem:** Forge needs certification but must not reimplement it.

**Integration Points:**

1. **Use `AddAshlar()` hosting registration:**
   ```csharp
   // Ashlar.Forge.Cli/Program.cs
   builder.Services.AddAshlar(options => {
       options.TrustEnabled = true;
       options.DeploymentProfile = "secure-workstation";
   });
   ```

2. **Consume `ICertificationGate` port:**
   ```csharp
   // Ashlar.Forge/ForgeService.cs
   public class ForgeService {
       private readonly ICertificationGate _gate; // injected from Ashlar.Hosting

       public async Task<ForgeResult> GenerateAppAsync(string objective) {
           var candidate = await _proposer.ProposeAsync(objective);
           var decision = await _gate.CertifyAsync(candidate); // Ashlar's gate
           if (decision.Outcome == CertificationOutcome.Admitted) {
               return ForgeResult.Success(candidate);
           }
           return ForgeResult.Rejected(decision.Reason);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Forge CI calls Ashlar cert-gate:**
   - `forge-gate.yml` includes step: `run: bash scripts/run-forge-cert-gate.sh`
   - Script uses Ashlar's `CertificationGate` via `ICertificationGate` DI

**Acceptance:**
- Forge `ForgeService.GenerateAppAsync` calls `ICertificationGate.CertifyAsync`
- Forge CI runs cert-gate on Forge-generated artifacts
- No Forge code reimplements certification logic

**Effort:** 3 days (integration + CI wiring)

#### M3.3: Publish Forge v0.1.0-alpha

**Acceptance:**
- Forge package published to NuGet: `Ashlar.Forge` v0.1.0-alpha
- Forge CLI installable: `dotnet tool install -g Ashlar.Forge.Cli --prerelease`
- Forge README documents: "This is an early product preview; uses Ashlar 0.1.2 core"

**Effort:** 1 day (packaging + publish)

### M3 Exit Criteria

- [ ] **M3.1** Forge repo scaffold exists and builds against published Ashlar
- [ ] **M3.2** Forge consumes `ICertificationGate` and `AddAshlar()` hosting
- [ ] **M3.3** Forge v0.1.0-alpha published
- [ ] **M3.4** Dependency-boundary-gate in Ashlar repo still passes (no `src/` → Forge refs)
- [ ] **M3.5** Blog post: "Introducing Forge: An Ashlar Product" (demonstrates separation)

**Owner:** Product team (Forge)  
**Dependencies:** M0 (architecture defined), Ashlar 0.1.2 published  
**Completion Target:** 6 days from M2 close (can overlap with M2 tail)

---

## M4: Forge.Verify — Cursor-Shaped Harness (Separate Product)

**Goal:** Forge consumes Ashlar's trust services to verify *Cursor-generated* apps, demonstrating that Ashlar certification is product-agnostic.

### M4 Concept

**Forge.Verify** is a Forge subcommand/module that:
- Accepts a Cursor-generated artifact (e.g., a React component, a Python script)
- Runs it through Ashlar's `CertificationGate` (witness, mutation, determinism)
- Issues a certificate if gates pass
- Demonstrates: "Ashlar certifies artifacts from ANY proposer, including Cursor"

### M4 Deliverables

#### M4.1: Cursor Artifact Adapter

**Problem:** Ashlar's gate expects bricks; Cursor generates arbitrary code.

**Adapter:**
```csharp
// Ashlar.Forge/Adapters/CursorArtifactAdapter.cs
public class CursorArtifactAdapter : IBrickCandidate {
    public CursorArtifactAdapter(string sourceCode, string language, Witness witness) {
        // Wrap Cursor source as a brick candidate
    }
}
```

**Acceptance:**
- Adapter converts Cursor source → `IBrickCandidate`
- Gate runs unchanged (witnesses are language-agnostic)

**Effort:** 2 days

#### M4.2: Forge.Verify CLI Command

```bash
$ ashlar-forge verify \
    --source cursor-output/Component.tsx \
    --witness witness.json \
    --output verification-report.json
```

**Acceptance:**
- Command loads Cursor artifact
- Runs through Ashlar `ICertificationGate`
- Outputs certificate or rejection report
- CI test: `ForgeVerifyCursorArtifactTests.CursorReactComponent_WithWitness_Certifies`

**Effort:** 3 days (CLI + integration test)

#### M4.3: Public Demo Artifacts

**Publish:**
- `examples/cursor-react-component/` (Cursor-generated React component)
- `examples/cursor-python-script/` (Cursor-generated Python script)
- Each with witness, certificate, and README explaining how it was verified

**Acceptance:**
- 2 example artifacts published in Forge repo
- README: "These were generated by Cursor and certified by Ashlar via Forge.Verify"

**Effort:** 2 days (documentation + examples)

### M4 Exit Criteria

- [ ] **M4.1** Cursor artifact adapter implemented
- [ ] **M4.2** `ashlar-forge verify` command works end-to-end
- [ ] **M4.3** 2 public Cursor-generated examples certified
- [ ] **M4.4** Blog post: "Certifying Cursor Output with Ashlar"

**Owner:** Forge product team  
**Dependencies:** M3 (Forge product exists)  
**Completion Target:** 7 days from M3 close

**Commercial Implication:** Positions Ashlar as certification infrastructure for *any* AI code generator, not just Ashlar's internal loops.

   - `objective-4-composition.json`
   - `objective-5-ui-component.json`
2. For each objective:
   - Run `ashlar-forge generate --objective $obj --mode autonomous`
   - Loop: propose → certify → (Tier 0) admit & swap OR (Tier 1) hold
   - Record: attempts, verdicts, artifacts, certificates
3. Publish results to public ledger (see M5.2)

**Acceptance:**
- CI job runs successfully on `v0.1.3` release
- 5 objectives attempted
- Ledger updated with results

**Effort:** 4 days (CI job + objective authoring)

#### M5.2: Public Ledger Implementation

                                                  M5 (dogfood ledger)

**Critical Path:** M0 → M1 → M2 → M5 → M6 (total: 59 days engineering + 2 weeks legal/security)

**Parallelizable:**
- M3 (Forge scaffold) can start during M2 (no blocking dependency)
- M4 (Forge.Verify) can overlap with M2 tail (once M3 scaffold exists)
- M6.2 (legal/security review) can start during M4–M5

### Risk & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Adversarial tests discover new defenses needed (M2)** | +10 days | Budget 20% contingency; prioritize kernel-touch smuggling and judge-growth (highest risk) |
| **Legal blocks autonomous claims (M6.2)** | Launch delayed | Start legal review early (during M4); prepare fallback: "Autonomous with operator oversight" (Tier 1 only) |
| **Forge team unavailable (M3–M4)** | Product demo blocked | Core team can stub Forge scaffold; defer full Forge.Verify to post-launch |
| **Public ledger attracts adversarial scrutiny** | Reputation risk | Expect it; have incident-response plan; ledger shows we patch findings (not hide them) |
| **Signature vulnerability (limitation 7–9) exploited before M1 close** | **Critical** | **Emergency fix:** Disable Ed25519-optional mode; require signatures immediately (breaks netstandard2.0 consumers — acceptable risk) |

## Timeline Estimate

**Conservative Estimate (Sequential):**

| Milestone | Duration | Cumulative |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| M0 (baseline) | **Complete** | Day 0 |
| M1 (harden) | 15–20 days | Day 20 |
| M2 (adversarial) | 25 days | Day 45 |
| M3 (Forge) | 6 days (overlaps M2 tail) | Day 45 |
| M4 (Forge.Verify) | 7 days | Day 52 |
| M5 (dogfood) | 9 days | Day 61 |
| M6.2 (legal) | 10 days (parallel to M4–M5) | Day 61 |
| M6.3–M6.4 (launch) | 5 days | **Day 66** |

**Aggressive Estimate (Parallel):**

- M1 + M3 (harden + Forge scaffold): 20 days
- M2 + M4 (adversarial + Forge.Verify): 25 days
- M5 + M6.2 (dogfood + legal): 10 days (parallel)
- M6.3–M6.4 (launch): 5 days
- **Total: 60 days** (with 3 teams running parallel)

**Recommendation:** Plan for **70 days** (10-week sprint) to allow for contingencies. Launch at 0.2.0 milestone.

## Success Metrics

### M1–M2: Technical Hardening

- **Zero** exploitable signature downgrades (limitations 7–9 closed)
- **Zero** false certificates in adversarial campaign (16/16 tests green)
- **100%** disarm mechanism coverage (pause, rollback, quarantine CI-proven)

### M3–M4: Product Separation

- **Zero** `src/Ashlar.*` → `Ashlar.Forge.*` references (dependency-boundary-gate enforces)
- **≥2** Cursor-generated artifacts certified via Forge.Verify

### M5: Public Accountability

- **≥3** historical dogfood runs in public ledger
- **100%** of ledger entries have: summary, proposals, verdicts, certificates/rejections

### M6: Commercial Launch

- **≥1** enterprise customer using Tier 0 autonomous admission in production
- **Zero** retractions/corrections to autonomous claims in first 30 days post-launch

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 7 Days)

1. **CEO sign-off on M0 baseline** (this document)
2. **Assign owners to M1–M6** (framework, product, CI, legal teams)
3. **Begin M1.1** (certification hardening) — limitations 7–9 are public; this is urgent
4. **Schedule legal kick-off** for M6.2 (2-week lead time needed)

### Strategic Priorities

**Priority 1: M1 (harden)** — Closes public vulnerabilities; must complete before any commercial claim.

**Priority 2: M2 (adversarial)** — Proves safety model; required for "adversarially validated" claim.

**Priority 3: M5 (public ledger)** — Public accountability is our differentiator; this unlocks "we show our work" positioning.

**Priority 4: M3–M4 (Forge)** — Demonstrates PRODUCT/CORE separation; shows Ashlar is platform, not monolith.

### Open Questions for CEO Decision

1. **Aggressive vs. conservative timeline?**
   - Aggressive (60 days, 3 parallel teams) = higher risk, faster launch
   - Conservative (70 days, sequential with overlap) = safer, milestone gates enforced

2. **Public ledger scope:**
   - Option A: Full artifacts published (proposals, certificates) = maximum transparency, potential IP exposure
   - Option B: Summaries only (verdicts, metadata) = less transparency, safer
   - **Recommendation:** Option A with anonymization/scrubbing pass (privacy audit in M6.2)

3. **What happens if M2 adversarial tests fail badly?**
   - Fallback: Launch with "Tier 1 only" (human admission always) — still valuable, less bold claim
   - Recommendation: Budget 20% contingency (M2 = 30 days instead of 25); if still blocked, trigger fallback decision at Day 30

4. **Forge ownership post-M3:**
   - Forge is extractable but not extracted yet (still in `products/Ashlar.Forge`)
   - Decision: Extract to separate repo immediately (M3), or keep in-tree until 0.2.0 launch?
   - **Recommendation:** Extract immediately (M3.1) — proves architecture, unblocks Forge team independence
