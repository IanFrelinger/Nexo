## Getting Started

### 1. Configuration

Create an `adaptation-config.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "Adaptation": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "ProcessingIntervalSeconds": 30,
    "LearningIntervalHours": 1,
    "MinConfidenceThreshold": 0.7,
    "PerformanceThresholds": {
      "CpuUtilizationThreshold": 0.8,
      "MemoryUtilizationThreshold": 0.8,
      "ResponseTimeThresholdMs": 5000
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Service Registration

Register the adaptation services in your application startup:

```csharp
using Nexo.Core.Application.Services.Adaptation;

// In Program.cs or Startup.cs
builder.Services.AddAdaptationServices(builder.Configuration);
```

### 3. CLI Commands

Use the CLI commands to monitor and manage the adaptation system:

```bash
# Check adaptation status
nexo adaptation status

# Monitor adaptations in real-time
nexo adaptation monitor --duration 300

# Trigger a specific adaptation
nexo adaptation trigger --type PerformanceOptimization

# View learning insights
nexo adaptation learning

# Check adaptation effectiveness
nexo adaptation effectiveness

# View system health
nexo adaptation health

# Show adaptation trends
nexo adaptation trends --hours 24

# Display full dashboard
nexo adaptation dashboard
```

## Adaptation Strategies

### Performance Optimization Strategy
- **CPU Optimization**: Switches to CPU-efficient iteration strategies when CPU usage is high
- **Memory Optimization**: Uses memory-efficient strategies when memory is constrained
- **Speed Optimization**: Prioritizes speed over complexity when response times are slow
- **Caching Strategy**: Enables/disables caching based on performance needs

### Resource Optimization Strategy
- **Memory Management**: Applies aggressive memory optimization when memory usage is high
- **Concurrency Control**: Adjusts concurrent operations based on available resources
- **Workload Scheduling**: Prioritizes high-priority workloads when resources are constrained
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamically allocates resources based on current usage

### User Experience Optimization Strategy
- **Interface Adaptation**: Adjusts UI based on user feedback
- **Workflow Optimization**: Improves user workflows based on usage patterns
- **Error Handling**: Enhances error messages and help based on common issues
- **Feature Prioritization**: Prioritizes features based on user preferences

### Environment Optimization Strategy
- **Development Mode**: Uses debug-friendly settings with verbose logging
- **Production Mode**: Applies aggressive optimizations with minimal logging
- **Platform-Specific**: Optimizes for Windows, Linux, macOS, or mobile platforms
- **Network Adaptation**: Adjusts behavior based on network speed and stability

## Learning System

### Pattern Recognition
The system identifies patterns in:
- **Performance Correlations**: Which strategies work best in specific situations
- **User Satisfaction**: What users prefer and what causes complaints
- **Platform-Specific Optimizations**: Which approaches work best on different platforms
- **Temporal Patterns**: How performance varies over time

### Insight Generation
Based on identified patterns, the system generates insights such as:
- "Performance improves by 30% when using CPU-optimized strategies on high-CPU systems"
- "Users prefer simplified interfaces over complex ones by 2:1 ratio"
- "Linux systems show 20% better performance with memory pooling enabled"

### Recommendation Engine
The system provides recommendations for:
- **Immediate Actions**: High-confidence improvements that can be applied immediately
- **Future Optimizations**: Suggestions for upcoming development work
- **Configuration Changes**: Recommended settings for different environments
- **Feature Development**: Suggestions for new features based on user needs

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Real-Time Dashboard
The dashboard provides:
- **System Health**: Overall health score and component health indicators
- **Performance Metrics**: CPU, memory, response time, and throughput
- **Active Adaptations**: Currently applied adaptations and their effectiveness
- **Learning Insights**: Recent insights and their confidence levels
- **Trends**: Performance and adaptation trends over time

### Metrics and KPIs
Key metrics tracked include:
- **Adaptation Effectiveness**: How much each adaptation improves performance
- **Learning Confidence**: Confidence level of generated insights
- **User Satisfaction**: Trends in user feedback and satisfaction
- **System Performance**: Overall system performance over time
- **Resource Utilization**: How efficiently resources are being used

## Best Practices

### 1. Gradual Rollout
- Start with monitoring enabled but adaptations disabled
- Enable adaptations gradually, starting with low-risk strategies
- Monitor effectiveness before enabling more aggressive adaptations

### 2. Threshold Tuning
- Adjust performance thresholds based on your specific requirements
- Start with conservative thresholds and adjust based on results
- Consider different thresholds for different environments

### 3. Feedback Collection
- Implement user feedback collection in your application
- Provide clear feedback mechanisms for users
- Regularly review and act on feedback trends

### 4. Monitoring
- Use the CLI commands regularly to monitor system health
- Set up alerts for critical performance issues
- Review adaptation effectiveness periodically

### 5. Learning Patience
- Allow time for the learning system to collect data
- Don't expect immediate results - learning improves over time
- Review learning insights regularly to understand system behavior

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Adaptations Not Triggering
- Check if the adaptation engine is enabled
- Verify performance thresholds are appropriate
- Ensure monitoring is collecting data

#### Low Effectiveness
- Review adaptation strategies for your specific use case
- Check if thresholds are too aggressive or conservative
- Verify that performance metrics are accurate

#### Learning System Not Working
- Ensure feedback collection is enabled
- Check if sufficient data is being collected
- Verify pattern recognition is functioning

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check detailed status
nexo adaptation status

# Monitor with verbose output
nexo adaptation monitor --duration 60

# View system health details
nexo adaptation health

# Check learning insights
nexo adaptation learning
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Strategies
You can implement custom adaptation strategies by implementing `IAdaptationStrategy`:

```csharp
public class CustomAdaptationStrategy : BaseAdaptationStrategy
{
    public override string StrategyId => "Custom.MyStrategy";
    public override AdaptationType SupportedAdaptationType => AdaptationType.PerformanceOptimization;
    
    public override async Task<AdaptationResult> ExecuteAdaptationAsync(AdaptationNeed need)
    {
        // Your custom adaptation logic here
        return CreateSuccessResult(adaptations);
    }
}
```

### Custom Learning Insights
Implement custom learning components:

```csharp
public class CustomPatternRecognitionEngine : IPatternRecognitionEngine
{
    public async Task<IEnumerable<IdentifiedPattern>> IdentifyPatternsAsync(
        IEnumerable<UserFeedback> feedback, 
        IEnumerable<PerformanceData> performance)
    {
        // Your custom pattern recognition logic
        return patterns;
    }
}
```

## Performance Impact

The adaptation system is designed to have minimal performance impact:
- **Monitoring Overhead**: < 1% CPU usage
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB for metrics and learning data
- **Network Impact**: Minimal, only for feedback collection
- **Storage**: < 100MB for historical data and insights

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: User feedback is anonymized and stored securely
- **Access Control**: CLI commands require appropriate permissions
- **Configuration Security**: Sensitive configuration is encrypted
- **Audit Logging**: All adaptations are logged for audit purposes

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements include:
- **Machine Learning Integration**: More sophisticated pattern recognition
- **Predictive Adaptations**: Proactive adaptations based on predicted needs
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Separate adaptation profiles for different users/teams
- **API Integration**: REST API for external monitoring and control
- **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed analytics and reporting capabilities

## Support

For support with the adaptation system:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review the CLI command outputs for error messages
3. Check the application logs for detailed error information
4. Consult the Nexo documentation for additional guidance

The adaptation system is designed to be self-healing and self-improving, but monitoring and occasional tuning will help ensure optimal performance.
