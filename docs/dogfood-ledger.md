# Dogfood Ledger

**Purpose:** Dated pass/fail evidence for demos before any autonomy or design-partner marketing claim. This ledger records what actually runs end-to-end for Ashlar dogfood / shippable-demo truth. Product copy stays with Marketing/Product 3000.

For the full gate catalog and block test commands, see [`docs/DogfoodValidation.md`](DogfoodValidation.md).

For scorecard thresholds and autonomy marketing unlock criteria, see [`docs/dogfood-scorecard.md`](dogfood-scorecard.md).

## Entries

| Date | Demo | Pass/Fail | Gap | Owner | Repro |
|------|------|-----------|-----|-------|-------|
| 2026-09-06 | Continuous dogfood proof infrastructure | **INFRA ONLY** | Workflow created but awaits PR #523 (Strict+Ed25519) before live Strict production runs. Until #523 lands, workflow documents the gap. | Dogfood Continuous | [PR TBD](https://github.com/IanFrelinger/Ashlar/pull/TBD) adds scheduled CI workflow `.github/workflows/dogfood-continuous-proof.yml` that will run Strict extend→certify→admit on canary objectives and auto-append dated results to this ledger. |

## Ledger Format

Each row documents one dated dogfood run or infrastructure milestone:

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD of the event/run
- **Demo:** Brief description of what was exercised (fixture name, PR milestone, infrastructure change)
- **Pass/Fail:** Outcome - PASS (with context), FAIL (with reason), INFRA ONLY, or GAP
- **Gap:** Known limitations, dependencies, or blockers (limitation 7/8/9 references, missing PRs, etc.)
- **Owner:** Team/component responsible (Dogfood Continuous, Cert Gate, etc.)
- **Repro:** Links to PR, commit SHA, CI run, or runbook for reproducing the result

## Continuous Proof

The scheduled workflow (`.github/workflows/dogfood-continuous-proof.yml`) runs autonomy loop sweeps on canary objectives and automatically appends rows to this ledger on completion. Rows are appended via CI automation; manual edits for infrastructure milestones are also permitted.

**Current canary:** `rgb-hex-parse` (6-digit hex color parser from `samples/autonomy-objectives/`)

**Scheduled cadence:** Weekdays (Monday-Friday) at 06:00 UTC

**Autonomy marketing unlock:** Requires passing scorecard thresholds (see `dogfood-scorecard.md`) for ~7 consecutive days. Marketing claims MUST remain HOLD until dated Strict production passes with Ed25519 appear in this ledger.
