    {
        // Log technical details for developers
        _logger.LogError(error, "User operation failed: {Context}", context);
        
        // Return user-friendly error message
        return error switch
        {
            AIProviderTimeoutException => new ErrorResponse
            {
                UserMessage = "AI service is temporarily slow. Please try again.",
                SuggestedAction = "Wait 30 seconds and retry",
                CanRetry = true
            },
            PipelineExecutionException => new ErrorResponse  
            {
                UserMessage = "Feature generation encountered an issue.",
                SuggestedAction = "Check your input and try again",
                CanRetry = true,
                FallbackOptions = ["Use simpler template", "Try different platform"]
            },
            _ => new ErrorResponse
            {
                UserMessage = "An unexpected error occurred. Your work has been saved.",
                SuggestedAction = "Contact support with error ID: " + Guid.NewGuid(),
                CanRetry = false
            }
        };
    }
