# Nexo Framework - Phase 3 Planning Summary

## Phase 2 Completion Status âœ…

**Phase 2 (AI Integration) is now 100% complete and validated:**

- **Test Success Rate**: 20/20 tests passing (100% - improved from 65%)
- **Functional Completion**: All core AI features implemented and working
- **Integration Validation**: All services properly integrated with mock infrastructure
- **Exception Handling**: Proper cancellation and error handling implemented
- **Agent Integration**: AI-enhanced agents working correctly with proper response handling

## Key Phase 2 Achievements

### 1. Enhanced Mock Infrastructure

### 3. Exception Handling & Cancellation
- **Selective Exception Catching**: Services allow `OperationCanceledException` to propagate
- **Maintained Error Handling**: Preserved error handling for other exceptions
- **Proper Cancellation Support**: Cancellation tokens work correctly across all services

### 4. Agent AI Usage Tracking
- **Proper Response Population**: Agent responses include content, success flags, and AI usage indicators
