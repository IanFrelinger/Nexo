## Demo Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Welcome to the future of game development. In the next 10 minutes, I'll build a complete, cross-platform game using Nexo. No boilerplate, no platform-specific code, no compromises on quality. Let's see what's possible when development is truly accelerated."

### Core Development (3 minutes)
"Let's start with the game loop. In traditional development, this would take hours of boilerplate. With Nexo's pipeline architecture, I can define the entire game flow in a few lines of code."

[Show pipeline creation]

"Now for the enemy AI. Instead of writing complex behavior trees, I'll ask Nexo's AI to generate intelligent enemy patterns."

[Show AI code generation]

"Notice how the same code automatically works across all platforms. No platform-specific modifications needed."

### Feature Factory (3 minutes)
"Here's where Nexo's Feature Factory really shines. Instead of building each system from scratch, I can generate entire game systems with single commands."

[Show UI generation]
"Responsive game HUD, generated in seconds."

[Show audio system]
"Spatial audio system with 3D positioning, ready to go."

[Show physics engine]
"2D physics with collision detection, optimized for performance."

### Deployment (2 minutes)
"Now let's build and deploy to all platforms simultaneously."
