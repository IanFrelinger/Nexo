# Production Readiness Gate v1

This document defines a strict, repeatable gate for deciding whether Ashlar is ready for production deployment in a given environment.

The gate is intentionally binary:

- **PASS**: all required checks pass, no unresolved High/Critical exceptions.
- **FAIL**: any required check fails, or any High/Critical exception remains unresolved.

---

## 1) Scope and intent

This gate covers:

- Build integrity and framework compatibility.
- Pipeline runtime correctness (validation, scheduling, fallback, retries, resume, durable persistence).
- Host wiring and CLI operability for production-style workflows.
- Minimal operational evidence from logs and JSON output.

This gate does **not** replace:

- Formal threat modeling.
- Full load/performance certification.
- Regulatory/compliance audits.

Those should run as additional gates (v2+). For a **structured program** covering release, security, operations, compliance, and reliability—with checklists you can track—see **`docs/production-readiness/README.md`**.

---

## 2) Required preconditions

- .NET SDK 10.x installed (repository is pinned via `global.json`).
- .NET 8 runtime/targeting support available for `net8.0` test/build lanes.
- Repository checked out cleanly.
- No local uncommitted production code modifications.
- Optional: `ASHLAR_PIPELINE_STORE_PROVIDER` and `ASHLAR_PIPELINE_STORE_PATH` available for durable resume validation.

---

## 3) Gate criteria (PASS/FAIL)

### A. Build and compatibility (required)

1. `Ashlar.Core.Application` builds for `netstandard2.0`.
2. `Ashlar.Infrastructure` builds.
3. `Ashlar.CLI` builds.

**Fail conditions**

- Any build command returns non-zero.
- Any compile-time errors.

---

### B. Pipeline runtime correctness (required)

1. Pipeline-focused infrastructure tests pass on `net8.0`.
2. Pipeline-focused infrastructure tests pass on `net10.0`.
3. Host DI smoke checks pass for default `AddAshlar` registration with pipeline layer present.

**Fail conditions**

- Any of the above test commands return non-zero.

---

### C. CLI operational correctness (required)

1. `pipeline validate` succeeds for a valid template.
2. Unconfigured `pipeline run` **fails closed**: `ok=false`, `state=Failed`, ingest error names the default placeholder (`No deterministic pipeline adapter is configured`). A stage that did no work must not be reported as having run.
3. The same fail-closed outcome holds when `ASHLAR_PIPELINE_ENABLE_TEST_HOOKS=1` is set — test hooks inject extra failures, they do not restore fabricated success.
4. `pipeline diagnostics` emits JSON.

**Fail conditions**

- Validation fails for known-good template.
- Unconfigured run reports `ok=true` or `state=Completed`.
- Ingest error does not name the unconfigured placeholder.
- Diagnostics produces no JSON payload.

---

### D. Durable resume correctness (required for production readiness)

Using `LiteDb` provider:

1. Create a failed run in one process invocation (unconfigured placeholder or test-hook failure).
2. Resume from that run in a second process invocation.
3. Resume finds the persisted source (does not report a missing prior run). Without a configured adapter the resumed run **stays Failed** — the gate proves durability, not fabricated completion.

**Fail conditions**

- Prior run not persisted/readable.
- Resume run cannot load source run (`no prior run was found`).
- Resumed run reports success without a configured adapter.

---

### E. Exceptions policy (required)

Any High/Critical exception to this gate requires:

- owner
- expiration date
- mitigation plan
- explicit sign-off

If missing any of the above -> **FAIL**.

---

## 4) Exact command set (reference implementation)

Run from repo root.

### 4.1 Build checks

```bash
dotnet build src/Ashlar.Core.Application/Ashlar.Core.Application.csproj -f netstandard2.0
dotnet build src/Ashlar.Infrastructure/Ashlar.Infrastructure.csproj
dotnet build application/src/Ashlar.CLI/Ashlar.CLI.csproj
```

### 4.2 Pipeline correctness checks

```bash
make production-readiness-gate-v1-tests   # counted Pipelines 68 (net8 + net10) + host-DI smoke 2
```

### 4.3 CLI operational checks

Create a temporary template file:

```bash
cat > /tmp/pipeline_gate_demo.json <<'JSON'
{
  "templateId": "gate-demo",
  "version": "1.0",
  "stages": [
    { "id": "ingest", "name": "Ingest", "mode": "Deterministic" },
    { "id": "hybrid", "name": "Hybrid", "mode": "Hybrid", "fallbackChain": ["Deterministic", "Agentic"] }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "fromStageId": "ingest", "toStageId": "hybrid" }
  ]
}
JSON
```

Validate and run (unconfigured adapter must fail closed):

```bash
dotnet run --project application/src/Ashlar.CLI -- pipeline validate --template /tmp/pipeline_gate_demo.json
dotnet run --project application/src/Ashlar.CLI -- pipeline run --template /tmp/pipeline_gate_demo.json --run-id gate-run-unconfigured --format-json
ASHLAR_PIPELINE_ENABLE_TEST_HOOKS=1 ASHLAR_PIPELINE_COMPLETION_POLICY=AllowNonCriticalStageFailures dotnet run --project application/src/Ashlar.CLI -- pipeline run --template /tmp/pipeline_gate_demo.json --run-id gate-run-hooks --input "fail:hybrid:deterministic=true" --format-json
dotnet run --project application/src/Ashlar.CLI -- pipeline diagnostics --format-json
```

### 4.4 Durable resume checks (LiteDb)

```bash
ASHLAR_PIPELINE_STORE_PROVIDER=LiteDb ASHLAR_PIPELINE_STORE_PATH=/tmp/ashlar_pipeline_gate_resume.db \
ASHLAR_PIPELINE_ENABLE_TEST_HOOKS=1 \
dotnet run --project application/src/Ashlar.CLI -- pipeline run --template /tmp/pipeline_gate_demo.json --run-id gate-resume-source --input "fail:ingest:deterministic=true" --format-json

ASHLAR_PIPELINE_STORE_PROVIDER=LiteDb ASHLAR_PIPELINE_STORE_PATH=/tmp/ashlar_pipeline_gate_resume.db \
dotnet run --project application/src/Ashlar.CLI -- pipeline run --template /tmp/pipeline_gate_demo.json --run-id gate-resume-target --resume-run-id gate-resume-source --resume-failed-stages --format-json
```

Cleanup:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/pipeline_gate_demo.json /tmp/ashlar_pipeline_gate_resume.db
```

## 5) CI integration recommendation

Add a dedicated workflow (recommended name: `production-readiness-gate-v1.yml`) that runs:

1. Build checks.
2. Pipeline tests for net8/net9.
3. Host DI smoke filter.
4. CLI validate + fail-closed unconfigured run + diagnostics.
5. Durable resume checks (LiteDb) — source and resume both Failed; resume must find the persisted source.

The workflow should:

- upload logs/artifacts (`trx`, command output),
- fail-fast on required command failures,
- emit a single PASS/FAIL summary.

---

## 6) Exit checklist for release candidate

Release candidate can proceed only when all are true:

- [ ] All sections A-D pass.
- [ ] No unapproved High/Critical exceptions.
- [ ] CI gate green on target branch.
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested.

---

## 7) Environment setup gate (recommended second gate)

Run `environment-setup-gate-v1` in GitHub Actions to validate dependency bootstrap and NuGet restore for each platform:

- `ubuntu-latest`: `scripts/setup/setup.sh check` + `scripts/setup/setup.sh restore`
- `macos-latest`: `scripts/setup/setup.sh check` + `scripts/setup/setup.sh restore`
- `windows-latest`: `scripts/setup/setup.ps1 -Mode check` + `scripts/setup/setup.ps1 -Mode restore`

This gate validates the repo can be prepared cleanly on each OS before functional/runtime gates run.
