/// Makes text the operator did not write safe to print on the operator's terminal.
///
/// <para>A console line is not a data structure — a terminal ACTS on some of the bytes in it. ESC
/// introduces an ANSI or OSC sequence that can move the cursor, repaint, or retitle the window; a
/// lone CR returns to column zero so what follows overwrites what was just printed; LF starts a new
/// line entirely. So a filename or a symlink target chosen by whoever wrote to a mesh store is not
/// merely ugly output — it is a way to FORGE a row. A name carrying a CR followed by
/// <c>  ✓ ADMITTED  update  · sealed by (a fingerprint the operator trusts)</c> paints a counterfeit
/// admission over its own refusal; the sealer fingerprint is the one part of a row the sender cannot
/// choose, so being able to overwrite it defeats the whole control.</para>
///
/// <para>Refusing such a name is not an option — the file is already on disk and the operator has to
/// be told WHICH file was refused. So it is printed, with every character a terminal would act on
/// replaced by U+FFFD. The row stays one line, the name stays recognisable, and the escape becomes
/// visible evidence instead of an instruction.</para>
///
/// <para>LENGTH IS THE SECOND HALF, and it is not cosmetic. Escaping alone leaves a sender able to
/// choose HOW MUCH the operator's terminal has to render. A package's <c>formatVersion</c> is a
/// required JSON string with no cap of its own, quoted straight into a refusal, so a 16&#160;MiB one
/// is a 16&#160;MiB refusal line: the row that named the file scrolls off the top of the scrollback,
/// and every legitimate row before it goes with it. Escaping turns each byte into U+FFFD without
/// making the line one character shorter, so the cap is part of the same job.</para>
///
/// <para>SHARED ON PURPOSE. Issue #483 tracks this same class at the pre-existing sites that print
/// sender-chosen text — a package summary, proposedBy, a course detail. Those are out of scope for
/// the change that added this file and are deliberately left alone, but they need exactly this
/// function; it lives here rather than as a private helper on one command so #483 can reuse it
/// instead of growing a second copy that drifts.</para>
