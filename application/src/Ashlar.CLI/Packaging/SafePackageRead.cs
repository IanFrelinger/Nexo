/// <see cref="FileInfo.Length"/> reports <b>0</b> for a FIFO, for a Unix socket, and for a character
/// device such as <c>/dev/zero</c> — byte-for-byte indistinguishable from an empty regular file —
/// and for a SYMLINK it reports the length of the target's PATH STRING rather than the target: a
/// link to a 400&#160;MB file measures about twenty bytes. So <c>if (file.Length &gt; max) refuse;</c>
/// PASSES for every one of them and the unbounded read behind it runs anyway.
/// <c>ln -s /dev/zero x.ashpkg</c> is an <see cref="OutOfMemoryException"/> that kills the pass,
/// <c>mkfifo x.ashpkg</c> is a permanent hang that wedges every pull on the fleet, and

/// directory, so each of those is a single command for anyone who can write to the share — cheaper
/// than the oversized file the ceiling was built for.</para>
///
/// <para>ON A SERVER the same metadata gap is worse than a local crash, because the link is followed
/// on someone else's behalf. <c>ln -s /etc/passwd d-secret.ashpkg</c> inside the published directory
