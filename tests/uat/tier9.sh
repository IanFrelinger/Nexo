# Ashlar UAT — Tier 9 (the release path).
#
# v0.1.0 is "production-usable core, experimental autonomy" (D5), and the mechanism that makes that
# more than a slogan is the public-API contract: stable-tier packages carry PublicAPI baselines, and
# what sits in PublicAPI.Shipped.txt at tag time is the promise. This tier checks the parts of the
# runbook that can be checked before anyone tags anything.
#
# It does not tag, pack or publish. `NuGet local pack -> StableSdkHostSample` already packs on every
# PR, and a release rehearsal that pushes artefacts is not something a gate should do by itself.
