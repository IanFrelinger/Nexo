# Epic 5.4: Deployment & Integration - Test Integration Summary

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished ✅

I have successfully integrated all Epic 5.4 tests into the existing C# command and aggregator structure used by the other tests in the project. The Epic 5.4 tests are now fully integrated with the TestAggregator system and can be run alongside other tests with full filtering and reporting capabilities.

## 🏗️ Integration Architecture

### ✅ Epic5_4TestSuite Class

**Core Components:**
- **`Epic5_4TestSuite`** - Main class that manages Epic 5.4 test discovery and execution
- **`DiscoverEpic5_4Tests()`** - Discovers all 18 Epic 5.4 tests with proper metadata
- **`ExecuteEpic5_4Test(string testId)`** - Executes specific Epic 5.4 tests by ID
- **Individual test methods** - 18 comprehensive Epic 5.4 test implementations

### ✅ Test Integration with TestAggregator

**Enhanced TestAggregator:**
- **Updated `DiscoverDefaultTests()`** - Now includes Epic 5.4 tests in default discovery
- **Enhanced `InvokeTestMethod()`** - Handles Epic 5.4 test execution via pattern matching
- **Added `RunEpic5_4Test()`** - Delegates to Epic5_4TestSuite for execution
- **Updated test discovery message** - Shows count of Epic 5.4 tests discovered

### ✅ Command Line Integration

**Enhanced Program.cs:**
- **Added Epic 5.4 command line options** - `--epic5-4-tests`, `--epic5-4-category`, `--epic5-4-priority`
- **Added Epic5_4TestRunner** - Dedicated test runner for Epic 5.4 tests
- **Enhanced help system** - Comprehensive help text with Epic 5.4 options
- **Added status display** - Shows Epic 5.4 test configuration in verbose mode
