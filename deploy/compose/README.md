# Compose stacks

All Docker Compose deployment stacks live here. Run them **from the repository root** so CWD-relative arguments (like `--env-file`) resolve as documented:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.portal.yml up -d --build
```

Build contexts and repo bind mounts inside these files point at the repository root (`../..`; relative host paths resolve against the compose file's directory, not the CWD), so images build and mounts resolve identically regardless of the invocation directory. Compose v2 also loads `.env` from this directory (`deploy/compose/.env`), not the repo root — use `--env-file <path>` for a file kept elsewhere. Override files are passed as a second `-f` after their base file.

> **Looking for a node to deploy?** None of these is one. `deploy/node.yml` is THE node — pinned by digest, state on a named volume, restart-durable. The stacks here are labs, demos and development stacks.
